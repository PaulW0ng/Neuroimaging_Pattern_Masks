## Methods

Atlas labels were generated by running freesurfer's Thalamic segmentation on
T1 and DWI data from 278 unrelated HCP participants. Individual segmentations
determined probabilities in the atlas.

Labels were grouped at successive levels of granularity. labels 1 is the 
maximal level provided by the histological segmentations that determine the
priors freesurfer used. Labels 2 is a slight adjustment to group subdivisions 
of nuclei (e.g. lateral/median, parvocellular, magnocellular), etc. Labels 3 
is based on the manual segmentation of Tregidgo (2023) Neuoimage, which 
represents nuclei that can be distinguished based on MR contrast alone (in
T1, T2 or FA data) and was used as the gold standard comparator for evaluating
the histological segmentations during development of the freesurfer algorithm.
labels 4 is the subdivision from iglesias 2018 Table 2.

## Comparison with Morel

The morel atlas is the most detailed histological atlas available in MNI space.
Its major limitation is that it is based on 6 participants (or maybe 3 and
mirror imaged, unclear), is not probablistic, and lacks an open license. The 
Iglesias atlas is based on 12 participants (or maybe 6 and mirror imaged) 
augmented by 55 in vivo scans that are used to calibrate probabilistic maps. 
In our case these are further mediated by projection to 278 individual's 
segmentations. That said, the number of thalamic regions that Iglesias et al 
(2018) Neuroimage could distinguish are fewer than those of the Morel atlas. 
The following equivalence mapping may be helpful for comparing and contrasting 
the resultant parcellations from each.

Morel -> Iglesias:
AD AM, AV -> AV
Hb -> Missing
LGNmc, LGNpc -> LGN
LP (more lateral) -> LP (more medial)
Li, SG -> L-SG
MDmc -> MDm (renamed to MDmc)
MDpc -> MDl (renamed to MDpc)
PuI + Po -> PuI
PuM -> PuMm PuMl
RN -> Missing
STh -> Missing
VLpd, VPLpv, VM -> VLp
VPLa, VPLp, VPI, VPM -> VPL
mtt -> Missing (this is a white matter tract though, not a nucleus)
