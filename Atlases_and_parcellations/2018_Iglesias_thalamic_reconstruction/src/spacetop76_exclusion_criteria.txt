Of 109 spacetop participants with DWI and T1 data, participants were excluded if 
- FA or T1 showed gross distortions (usually frontopolar regions), n=3
- poor DWI to T1 intermodal alignment by QSIPrep (often a consequence of frontopolar succeptibility artifacts), n=14
- bad DWI fields of view, n=7
- extreme RF noise, n=7 (sub-0097 to sub-0103)
- or a very poor thalamic segmentation, n=2 (sub-0013, sub-0052)
Total excluded: 33/109
