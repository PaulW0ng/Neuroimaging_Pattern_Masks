275 unrelated twin pairs were considered. Among twin pairs, individuals were
selected based on the availability of DWI and T1 data and then based on 
whomever had better snr_csf snr_total, rpve_csf and rpve_wm MRIQC IQMs.

From the 275, 11 participants were excluded from this dataset
- 10 were excluded due to bad QSIPrep intermodal alignment
- 1 was excluded due to a bad acquisition FOV for the DWI data
